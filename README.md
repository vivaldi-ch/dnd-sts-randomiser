# Dungeon and Dragons x Slay the Spire

This website is used to generate a random loot for encounters in a custom game derived from [DnD](https://dnd.wizards.com/)'s basic mechanic and inspired by [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/).

_PS: Both are really cool games, you should try them out!_

Built on GatsbyJS for ease of deployment, using Tailwind CSS for minimal-effort decent look.

You can check the deployed website [here](https://dnd-sts.ibel.io).
